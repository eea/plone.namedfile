Add picture method to to ImageScaling and include it in @@image-test.
Picture tags only work on Plone 6, with several other branches for picture variants merged.
See `plip-image-srcsets.cfg <https://github.com/plone/buildout.coredev/blob/6.0/plips/plip-image-srcsets.cfg>`_.
If not available (like on Plone 5.2), an ordinary image tag is created.
